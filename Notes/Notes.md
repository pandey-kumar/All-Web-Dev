# DOM Manipulation :-

we can do two things :- 

1. get The Element 
2. Event Listening

# Event Listeners 

while using event listeners like click in the js if you provide call back function that it will give acess to window object while using the normal function will give acess to that particular element.

## There are many event Listeners you can use them as required


# ADVANCE JAVASCRIPT

# Closure 

> In JavaScript, a closure is a function that "remembers" the variables from its lexical scope even when it is executed outside that scope

# Promises 

>A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows you to handle asynchronous tasks such as API calls, file reading, or setTimeout more cleanly compared to traditional callback functions.

> there are three states of it :- 1. pending 2. fullfiled 3. Rejected



#  Call(), apply (), Bind()

>In JavaScript, call(), apply(), and bind() are methods used to control the value of this when invoking a function. They allow you to explicitly set the context (this) for a function, which is particularly useful when working with objects.

# Async and Await

> these are another method to handle the promises like .then .catch if you are making a function async then await must be used inside.


## Promise.all([p1(),p2(),...]);


> this is used to call all the promises in a short syntax and can be destructured as array

## Iterator and Generator Functions:-

> use to execute in sequence and remebers how many times called
function* fun_name(){
    yeild 1;
    yeild 2;
    yeild 3;
}

> console.log(fun_name().next().value);

## Module and Common js

// Module:-  we use import export the things

// common js:- we use require to import and we export using module.exports={f1,f2,f3,......}

# note:-  for module we need to either save file as .mjs or change in package.json as type:module to run perfectly
